name: Stellar Binaries are Bound from Birth
description: |-
  This capsule includes the scripts used to identify gas halos and multiples for the article "Stellar Binaries are Bound from Birth" (abstract below). We provide a smaller demo dataset with this capsule, from a StarForge simulation of a smaller cloud with 2x10^3 Msun. While sharing the full end-to-end analysis from the paper is impractical, this capsule will make our halo and multiple identification algorithms reproducible.

  Abstract: "Most main sequence stars, unlike our Sun, are members of systems with two or
  more stars. Exactly how and when these systems form and become gravitationally
  bound remains debated, since resolving the earliest stages of star formation is
  challenging. We analyze simulations of star cluster formation representative of
  typical Milky Way conditions that include all key physics and stellar feedback
  mechanisms, to understand how multiples systems form. We show that ≈ 80%
  binary systems are gravitationally bound from the point at which the secondary
  star forms. The initial stellar motions are imprinted by the natal gas, which brings
  pairs together. Half of the binaries are disrupted by the end of the star-formation
  epoch, such that ≈ 20% of the final single stars belonged to binary systems at
  some point. A similar fraction of binaries have exchanged companions."
